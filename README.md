# Fridge Master 2000

Home of the code that will hopefully soon run my raspberry pi 'smart' fridge system. 

Currently Fridge Master 2000 is able to

- Measure temp and humidity in the fridge
- Know if fridge and/or freezer doors are open 
- Send sms alerts via Twilio if the temp goes above certain threshold or if either door has been open for too long
- Display the above plus date, time and CPU temp to an LCD
- Log all measurements into csv files and upload them to local FTP server

# Design Details 
The images below are accurate to the FRIDGE MASTER design except the push switches are being used as stand ins for the magetic contact switches as the are functionally almost identical.
