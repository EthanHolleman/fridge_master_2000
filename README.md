# fridge_master_2000

Home of the code that will hopefully soon run my raspberry pi 'smart' fridge system. 

Project is still very much in the works but by the end it should be capable of the following.

- Measure temp and humidity in the fridge
- Know if fridge and/or freezer doors are open 
- Send sms alerts via Twilio if the temp goes above certain threshold or if either door has been open for too long
- Display the above plus date, time and CPU temp to an LCD
- Log all measurements into csv files and upload them to local FTP server
