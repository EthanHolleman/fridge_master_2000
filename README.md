# Fridge Master 2000

Home of the code that will hopefully soon run my raspberry pi 'smart' fridge system. 

Currently Fridge Master 2000 is able to

- Measure temp and humidity in the fridge
- Know if fridge and/or freezer doors are open 
- Send sms alerts via Twilio if the temp goes above certain threshold or if either door has been open for too long
- Display the above plus date, time and CPU temp to an LCD
- Log all measurements into csv files and upload them to local FTP server
